Used Traversy's media React JS Crash Course to practice working with a greenfield React project.

The link to the tutorial is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8&list=WL&index=3&t=4620s

For some reason, my code seems to run a line of code that says console.log('Click') instead of the actual code in the header and nothing I have done seems to work to run the actual code I have replaced that line with. 

I don't have the patience to continue trying to figure out what is going wrong with this project so I'm going to take a break from it for a while.
